Hi Ronald!

Thanks again for your interest in working with us. As a next step, we ask candidates to complete a short practical WordPress skills test. This helps us confirm real-world experience and make sure we’re aligned on how work gets done.

Time expectation: 4–6 hours
Environment: We’ve already set up a staging site for you and will provide access details separately.
Current setup: Avada and ACF Pro are already installed. You will need to install and configure WooCommerce as part of this exercise.

What to submit:

Completed work on the staging site

A ZIP file or Git repository containing any custom code you added

Clear notes explaining what the code does and where it was implemented (for example: child theme functions file, custom plugin, template override, hook, etc.)

A short written explanation of your decisions and approach

This is not a trick test or trivia exercise. It reflects the type of work we do day to day.

Part 1: Theme & Layout (Avada)
Using the existing staging site, create a simple marketing page with Avada Builder.

Requirements:

Hero section with background image, headline, and CTA button

Three-column features section

One reusable global element (for example, a CTA strip)

Responsive behavior for mobile and tablet

Part 2: Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)
Create a Custom Post Type called Case Studies.

Add ACF fields:

Client Name (text)

Project URL (URL)

Industry (select)

Featured Result (number with suffix, e.g. “+42%”)

Flexible Content field with at least two layouts

Display the content on:

A single case study template

A listing page with a query loop

Please output dynamic data properly (not embedded directly inside page builder text blocks).

Part 3: WooCommerce
Install and configure WooCommerce on the staging site, then set up:

One simple product

One variable product with at least two attributes

Customizations:

Add a custom product badge (for example, “Best Seller”) using hooks or filters

Display a custom ACF field on the single product page

Please do not edit WooCommerce core files.

Part 4: Debugging Scenario
Briefly explain how you would handle the following situation:

A recent site update caused the checkout page to white-screen. Debug mode shows a fatal error related to a custom function added recently.

Describe how you would:

Isolate the issue

Diagnose the root cause

Prevent similar issues in the future

Part 5: Short Written Questions
Please answer briefly:

When would you recommend avoiding the Avada Builder?

ACF fields are stored in the database by default. How do you ensure ACF field groups stay in sync across development, staging, and production without manually recreating them or editing fields directly on production?

How would you reduce risk during plugin updates?

How do you decide between using a hook, a template override, or a custom plugin?

There’s no single “right” way to approach this. We’re primarily evaluating structure, clarity, and judgment.

Please confirm once you’ve received staging access and started, and let us know when we should expect your submission.
