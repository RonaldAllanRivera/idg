Wordpress Developer
We’re looking for a seasoned Front End WordPress Developer to join our agency team. This role is a mix of building new sites and improving existing ones, with a strong focus on performance, SEO, and long-term maintainability.

This is not a “click some buttons and ship it” role. We care about clean code, fast load times, and sites that don’t fall apart six months later.

What you’d be working on:

Building new WordPress sites from concept through launch
Improving and maintaining existing WordPress builds
Implementing Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for flexible, scalable content
Writing custom JavaScript when plugins aren’t the right solution
Working within established themes and frameworks, including Avada and Enfold
Translating designs into responsive, accessible HTML and CSS
Optimizing for Core Web Vitals, PageSpeed, and real-world performance
Reducing bloat from themes, plugins, and unnecessary scripts
Collaborating with SEO and marketing teams to support rankings and conversions

What we’re looking for:

4+ years of professional WordPress development experience
Strong HTML and CSS skills (non-negotiable)
Solid JavaScript experience for front end customization
Deep experience with ACF
Strong understanding of technical and on-page SEO
Proven experience improving WordPress performance
Comfortable working within existing themes and frameworks
Familiarity with Git and collaborative workflows
Ability to work independently and make smart technical decisions

Bonus Points:

Experience with Avada, Enfold, or similar theme frameworks
Experience integrating APIs or third-party services
Gutenberg block experience
Working knowledge of PHP
Experience and comfort juggling multiple projects


If this sounds like your kind of work, we’d love to talk. Please reply with a few examples of WordPress sites you’ve worked on and a brief note on your role in each.
